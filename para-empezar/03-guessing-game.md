```rust
use std::io
```

Brings input/output library to the scope.

> ## By the default Rust only includes a few types into the scope of every program in the `prelude`.

> `let` to declare a variable

```rust
let var = value;
```

Variables are immutable by default. To make a variable mutable use `mut`

```rust
let mut variable = mutableValue
```

```rust
String::new() // Creates a new empty string
```

> String string type from std library. Growable, UTF-8 encode bit of text
>
> ::new Indicates that new is an `associated function` of the String type, rather than on an instance. "static method"

```rust
function(& variable)
function(&mut variable)
```

> & Indicates we are passing a reference instead a variable. references allow multiple parts of your code access one piece of data without needing to copy that data into memory multiple times. As variables, references are immutable by default. `&mut` to change that.

`enums` is a type that can have a fixed set of values.

`readline()` returns a `Result` type. `Result` types are enums. It's variants are `Ok` and `Err`.

An instance of the `io::Result` type has method `expect`

```rust
if (io::Result === Err ) {
  program crashes, and displays message from `expect`
} else () {
  // io::Result === Ok
  `expect` takes the value that Ok is holding and returns it for you to use.
}
```

```rust
let panda = 🐼;
let pig = 🐷;
printl!("Panda {}, Pig {}", panda, pig)
```

To print variables we use `{}` to indicate the position where the value will be inserted.

`crate` &gt; package of rust code. Extra functionality ! crates.io is where you can publish crates.

To add a a crate in our project we update the \[dependencies\] section in the toml file.

```text
[dependencies]
crate_name = "sem.ver"
```

After a crate is installed and compiled the `cargo.lock` file is updated. This will garantee reproducible builds everywhere everytime. If you want to update the crates verison run

```text
cargo update
```

But it will only update minor versions. if the package has a major release, update your `.toml` file maually.
